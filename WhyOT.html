	<h1>Why do you want to become an OT?</h1>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p>If you ever received OT before, I highly recommend you to say it because when you have that experience, you can:</p>
	<ol>
<li>Touch the hearts of the admission staffs</li>
<li>Show how determined you are in becoming an OT.</li>
</ol>
	<p>The most common answer for this question is that an applicant see their grandparents receiving therapy and amazed by how fast they heal. 
If you have this cliché experience, or if you do not receive any OT before, 
I suggest you to actively participate and even conduct therapy such that you have an active experience, thus demonstrating a stronger motivation to become an OT.</p> 

	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p>I want to become an OT because I received OT before. 
	When I was three, I have no speech, no eye-contact and have severe muscle development delay. 
	However, my OT assisted me, such that I could look into my mother’s eyes, and said my first word “Pee,” requesting her to help me to do my toiletry. 
	Furthermore, thanks to my OT, I now can do activities as simple as holding a pen to as complex as conducting a group project. 
	I discovered that I am living a fulfilling life because of OT. 
	In order to be as influential as my OT, I decided to become an OT myself.</p>
