	<h3>Courses</h3>
	<p class="indented">Although each OT school has its own set of unique prerequisites, 
	in order to give you an idea of what the OT schools prerequisites are, 
	I categorized all the courses I seen in OTCAS into MUST, OPTIONAL and BOOSTER course. 
	If you take all of the courses listed and earn a grade of B+ or above, you can apply to every OT school in the US.  
	However, you do not need to take all of these courses, 
	you just need to satisfy the prerequisites of the school that you are applying to.</p> 
	
	<h3 id="MUST" class="MUST">MUST: All of the OT schools required you to take these courses.</h3>
	<p class="MUST"><b>Physiology with Lab</b> OR <b>Anatomy & Physiology I and Anatomy & Physiology II</b><br />
	<b>Introduction to Sociology</b><br />
	<b>Cultural Anthropology</b><br />
	<b>Abnormal/Clinical Psychology:</b> Clinical and Abnormal Psychology are the same courses.<br /> 
	<b>Lifespan Human developmental psychology:</b> Some schools would only require childhood developmental psychology. 
	However, I would go for lifespan developmental psychology because most schools require this course.<br /> 
	<b>Statistics:</b> No business statistics. Intro to stats or preferably psychological statistics will do.</p>
	
	<h3 id="OPTIONAL">OPTIONAL: BUT. You are better off, if you take these classes because some OT schools required you to take these courses. </h3>
	<p><b>Technical Writing:</b> Classes such as Reading, Composition, and Research or Analysis, Research, and Documentation. 
	This course is required by VCU, EWU and TJU, so this course is highly recommended if you want to go top-tier OT schools.<br />
	<b>Human Growth and Development:</b> If you have this prerequisite, ask the staff to make sure if it is a biology or a psychology course.<br /> 
	<b>Research Methods:</b> This is not statistics, but another course about research. (I only see this requirement for Utica College. )<br /> 
	<b>Bioethics:</b> It does not have to be related to medicine: I took mine based on foods.<br />
	<b>Craft course:</b> Ceramics, sculpture, woodworking, knitting, quilting, sewing, jewelry making. <br /> 
	<b>Math course:</b> Schools, such as ATSU and University of Kansas Medical Center, require math courses, such as pre-calculus. However, I prefer calculus or more challenging math courses, in order to make sure that I satisfied the requirement.<br />
	<b>Humanities:</b> Art, history, philosophy, religion, language, theater arts. Schools, such as Columbia, required this kind of requirement.<br /> 
	<b>Public Speaking:</b> Great class to get your recommender.<br />
	<b>General Psychology<br /> 
Medical Terminology:</b>Schools, such as EWU, USC, University of Florida, require this course  <br />
<b>Computer Competency:</b> The OT school that needs this requirement is <br />
<b>Kinesiology or Exercise Science<br />
Chemistry<br />
Physics<br />
Biology<br />
Neuroscience with/without lab</b><br />

<h3 id="BOOSTER" class="BOOSTER">BOOSTER: Introduction to Occupational Therapy</h3>
<p class="BOOSTER">Take this class online and you will probably understand everything that your OTs did.  
Also, if you take this class and use the concepts in your interview, you will sound super smart to your interviewers.</p>
 
<h3 id="ask">How to ask the admission staff if your courses satisfy the OT school prerequisites:</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about the requirement, such as:
<ul class="blank">
<li>Does my course satisfy the prerequisite?</li>
<li>Where can I take this course online?</li>
<li>MORE QUESTIONS that I never think of</li>
</ul>
<p>You can always ask the admission staff, but <u><b>always remember to attach the brief review and the syllabus of the course!</b></u>
<h3>Format</h3>
