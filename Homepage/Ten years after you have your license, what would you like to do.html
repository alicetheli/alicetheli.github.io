	<h1>Ten years after you have your license, what would you like to do?</h1>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p><b>Take advantage of silence</b>. Professor Tyszka asked me what I want to do ten years after I become a practitioner. 
	<i>I want to become a practitioner and establish my own clinic to make a lot of money.</i> This is NOT the answer that she is looking for.<br />
	Usually, the appropriate answers are ways that you are going <i>to advance OT</i> through:<br />
	<ul class="blank">
	<li>Advocacy</li>
	<li>Research</li>
	<li>Inventions</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p> If you want to advance OT through advocacy, I recommend you to use the Rehabilitation Act because not all students, even some OT students, do not know the Rehabilitation Act.<br /> 
	Although there is a Rehabilitation Act, saying that all people of all background deserve therapy regardless of their social economic status, the State is not funding the therapy for children from zero to three. 
	Considering that zero to three is a sensitive age range for children to grow, 
	if these children do not receive the therapy they need, they may not become functional and independent adults by the time they grow up. 
	Therefore, I believe that it is important for me as a future occupational therapist to advocate for these kids such that they can have the therapy they deserve.<br />
	*Considering that affordable treatment is also a problem in the US, if you have time, talk about ObamaCare, aka Affordable Care Act, and say how you would like to improve it.<br />
	I would also want to improve his Obamacare. 
	Although this law reinforced all employers to give their full-time employeesâ€™ health insurance, 
	major companies, like Walmart, are trying to dodge the law by hiring part-time employees, such that they do not need to spend the money to give these employees health insurance. 
	Unfortunately, these employees are the underprivileged ones, who urgently need health insurance, but cannot afford it. 
	Thus, I would like to talk to Obama on how he would change the law, such time part-time employees get their health benefits.</p>
