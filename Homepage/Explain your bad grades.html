	<h1>Explain why you have your bad grades</h1>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p>Students should be as honest as possible while answering this question. 
	(OK, you should not say that you did badly because you did not study.) 
	However, at least, you should tell the interviewer:</p>
	<ol class="blank">
	<li>How you have tried hard for the course</li>
	<li>What you learn from taking this course</li>
	<li>What you did to improve for the next time</li>
	</ol>
	<p>By doing these steps, you can tell your interviewers how you can prevent yourself from having bad grades while you are attending their OT program.</p>
	<h3>My answer</h3>
	<p> When I go to UC Berkeley, I was unsure if I should major in biology or psychology. 
	Thus, I took Biology 1A and 1B. 
	Although those classes do intrigue me, I struggled in the exams even I went to review sessions conducted by student leaders for about four hours a week. 
	By the end of the semester, I decided to evaluate my deficit, and discovered that I need to improve my note-taking skills. 
	As a result, I worked on my note-taking skills, and improved when I took my next note-heavy courses.</p>
