<p>Frame Of Reference, FOR, is very important! Because frame of reference helps the occupational therapist to stay organize with their specialty!<br />
Frame of Reference contains these FIVE things:</p>
<ol class="blank">
<li><b>Population</b><br />
<center><img src="Population.png" alt="Population" /></center><br />
Who are your clients? Do the clients have mental, physical or a social need?</li>
<li><b>Continuum of function/dysfunction:</b>
<center><img src="Spectrum of function.png" alt="Spectrum of function" /></center><br />
Where is the client level in the spectrum of function or dysfunction?</li>
<li><b>Theory Regarding Change:</b>

<li><b>Role of the practitioner:</b><br />

<li><b>Assessment Instructions:</b> What kind of evaluation should the practitioner do? Interview, observation or standard test?
For example in the geriatric OTs look at how well a patient can maintain their balance and how well do they do their ADLs.</li>
