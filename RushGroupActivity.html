	<h1>Collaborate with your group members and write a three sentence response for this question in ten minutes:<br /> 
	If you walked into a hospital room to work with a patient and he wanted to wait until a TV program was over, how would you handle the situation?</h1>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p class="indented">	If this patient is completely new to the hospital, 
	I would evaluate his cognitive abilities by testing him on the content of the TV show and use Barthel Index of ADLs to see his ADL performance level, 
	such as eating and standing up in front of the TV. If I discovered that the patient has poor cognition, such as being unable to comprehend the TV content,
	I would turn off the TV and emphasize the importance of therapy to start our treatment session. However, if the patient has highly functional cognition, 
	I would ask him why he is watching the TV and how we can arrange the therapy based on his interests, like having the therapy outside the show time.</p>
