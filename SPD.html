<h1>Sensory Processing Disorder</h1>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul class="blank">
	<li>We have more than five senses.</li> 
	<li>Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) is when your brain cannot interpret these senses appropriately, such that you can become too sensitive and/or under-sensitive.</li>
	<li>Because the symptoms of SPD look like autism and ADHD, the controversy is whether SPD should be an independent disorder, or a symptom of autism and ADHD.</li>
	<li>The psychiatrists believe that the disorder is merely a symptom of ADHD or SPD. On the other hand, the OT believe that SPD is an independent disorder for forty years.</li>
	<li>OTs believe that SPD is an independent disorder because most research shows that kids with SPD have a significantly different sensory profile than children with just ADHD or autism.  
	(Sensory Profile is a caregiver, such as parents, report about how children react to the stimuli in their environment. 
	Therefore, this profile can show how children react to smell, taste, hearing, vision and other senses.)</li>

<h3 id="Knowing">Knowing the senses (If you know the anatomy of all the senses, skip this part.)</h3>
<p class="indented">In order to fully understand Sensory Processing Disorder, I want to make sure that we know all the senses in our human bodies. 
First, we have <i>more</i> than five senses. 
The senses are first categorized by where the senses are detected: Does it detect stimuli in the somatic region, or around the surface of the body? 
Or does it detect stimuli at the visceral region, or deep in the body? 
After that the senses are further group into how frequently they are found in the body. 
Are they seen in a “specialized" location? Or “generally” around the whole body?</p>

<h3>Let's look at the more "unknown" senses</h3>
<p><b>Balance</b> is often called the vestibular sense because the balance receptors only exist in the semicircular canals and the <i>vestibule</i>of the ear. (Ah ha!)</p>
<center><img src="Inner ear.jpg" alt="Inner ear" width="692" length"397" /></center>

<p class="indented">Considering that we are always moving out head even when we are seating still, the vestibule and the semicircular canals prevent us from feeling dizzy! 
However, it cannot always prevent us from feeling dizzy, such as after spinning for too long, or squirting water into our ear, we feel dizzy too because we are squirting directly onto our vestibule!</p>

<p class="indented"><b>Proprioception</b> is the ability to sense where our arms and legs are when we are both still and moving. 
Plus, it helps us to know which muscle, tendon and joint we are using. 
For example, proprioception helps some of us to type the keyboard without looking at the keyboard. 
Furthermore, thanks to proprioception we can do silly, but amazing things: We can close our eyes and still touch our nose! 
Proprioceptors, the proprioception detectors, are located in:</p>

<h3 id="SPD">Defining Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)</h3>
<p class="indented">Considering that all of these senses go to the brain, what happen when a patient’s brain cannot interpret, 
or process, these stimuli appropriately? Then these patients have sensory processing disorder. 
However, SPD is an umbrella term for all sensory processing disorders, it is further divided into “subtypes.” Here is the chart.</p> 
<center><img src="SPDchart.jpg" alt="Subtypes of SPD"></center> 
<p>However, USUALLY, when pediatric OTs talked about SPD, they are talking about the disorders in the <b class="red">RED BOX</b> because pediatric OTs treats these patients the most. So I will spend the time talking about the subtypes, 
Sensory Over- Responsivity, Sensory Under-Responsivity, and Sensory Craving. The table below shows the characteristic and the sensory problems that each subtype patient faces.</p>

<p class="indented">It can be difficult to differentiate sensory-craving and sensory under-responsivity because at the outside, 
the kids can display similar symptoms. For example, both kids are shouting as they speak. 
However, they are shouting for different purposes: 
The sensory-under responsive kid shout to hear, but the sensory craving kid shout to receive their auditory stimuli.</p>

<p class="indented">To make diagnosing more complicated, a patient with SPD can have different kind of impairments across all of their senses: 
For example, a patient can crave for proprioceptive stimuli, but be under-responsive to touch, and hypersentive to hearing.</p> 

<h3 id="controversy">The SPD Controversy</h3>
<p class="indented">Looking at these symptoms, don’t these symptoms sounds like symptoms of autism and ADHD? 
When kids with autism are spoken to, they look into somewhere else, instead of establish eye contact. 
Most psychiatrists would say that their lack of eye contact is caused by social deficit, not by a sensory deficit. 
The kid who runs nonstop in the classroom: Is he craving  for proprioception inputs, or does he have lack of impulse control because of ADHD? 
Therefore, the question is: <b>Does SPD exists on its own or just another symptom of autism and ADHD?</b></p> 
<p class="indented">Currently, the DSM-5, the bible of psychiatry, does not recognize this disorder: 
The DSM revisionists believe that SPD is a symptom of autism and ADHD. 
Furthermore, they believe that SPD needs more research to be understood. 
On the other hand, OTs believe SPD exists, and it is completely different from autism and ADHD.</p>
<h3 id="Why">Why SPD is an independent disorder?</h3>
<p>ADHD and SPD are different because the patients with SPD:</p>
<ul class="blank">
<li>Have significantly more sensory issues than the patients with ADHD. (Lane et al., 2010; Miller, Nielsen, & Schoen, 2012)</li>
<li>Are significantly more anxious that the ADHD group (Lane et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2012)</li>
<li>Different neurology: These groups have abnormal white matter microstructure in different areas. In simple words, ADHD has problem at the FRONT of the brain, but the SPD has problem at the BACK of the brain.(Owen et al., 2013)*</li>
</ul>
<p>*Although there is no current study comparing ADHD to SPD on the neurological level, the DTI (the X-ray to see the brain connection, especially the white matter) 
data consistently shows that ADHD has problem at the frontal lobe connection, specifically superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior coronal radiate and fronto-strial pathways. 
However, a study in 2013 by Owen et al from UCSF used DTI to show that children with SPD have significantly less connections with their posterior corpus callosum, 
which is the portion of the brain that connects the two hemispheres.</p>

<p><b>Autism and SPD</b></p>
<p>There is neurological difference between these two disorders (Chang et al., 2014). Here is the difference in pictures:<br />
<figure>
<center><img src="SandA.jpg" alt="SPD and Autism differences"></center>
<figcaption>Patients with SPD and ASD are different because the neurological wiring in their brains are different.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><b>Side note:</b> This is a study conducted by the same group of UCSF researchers who in 2013 discovered that SPD have lower connection at the posterior corpus callosum compared to healthy controls.<br />

<h3 id="Effects">Effects of SPD not existing in the DSM-5</h3>
<ul class="blank">
<li>The insurance companies do not cover SPD treatments, such as sensory integration. Thus, the treatment fee can be as high as $100/hr, 
making some children and adults avoid seeking treatment. (Childs, 2012)</li>
<li>Many children with SPD are misunderstood such that they are expelled from school (Levingston, 2012).</li>
<li>Many children are misdiagnosed as having ADHD and consuming unnecessary medication (SPD foundation, 2015)</li>
