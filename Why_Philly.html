	<h1>Why do you want to come to XYZ city?</h1>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p>If you are out of state, make sure you know the city of the college that you are applying for. Some interviewer may ask this question because they want to make sure 
	that you know how to have a great life even if you are thousand miles away from your family.<br />
	Fortunately, I did take a bus trip and a subway trip to visit Down Town Philadelphia for an interview near Philadelphia, so I know what I like about the city,
	and answer the question honestly.</p>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p>Because our interview turned into a casual conversation, I just speaked out whatever comes to my mind.<br />
	"CHINA TOWN." There is this great restaurant called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpiceCnoodles" target="+blank">Spicy C</a>.
	That restaurant has the best beef noodle soup in the US! Furthermore, my brother lives in Pittsburgh, so if I come to Salus, 
	I can go visit him because we are only an airport away from one another! This is exciting because I have not see my brother for two years.</p>
	<h3>Commentary</h3>
	<p>I purposely talk about my brother, so I can indirectly tell my interviewer saying that I will have familial support even if I am studying without my families nearby. 
	By the way, I am not lying! I do have an older brother studying in University of Pittsburgh! XD</p>
