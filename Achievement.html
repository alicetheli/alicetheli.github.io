	<h1>What achievement are you the most proud of?</h1>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p class="indented">Your proudest achievement does not have to OT related. It can be anything, such as raising a guide dog, or work-study while taking maximum unit at your school. However, mine is OT related.</p>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p class="indented">Besides making a splint by myself, my proudest achievement is to help an ALS patient to control the computer without his hands, but by using his head and neck. 
	I utilized a software call the Camera Mouse, which used the webcam to detect the usersâ€™ head and neck, such that the user can control the computer cursor by moving their head and neck. 
	I also used CNTDesigner, so I can customize an on-screen keyboard for the ALS patient to type faster. 
	By the end of our sessions, the patient had already sent three letters to his wife and two daughters, telling them how much he loves them.
	Plus, he can now type a sentence in less than three minutes.</p>
