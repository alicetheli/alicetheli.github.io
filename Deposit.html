	<h1>Deposit Info</h1>
	<p>Usually, the admission staff will tell you to put in XYZ amount of money in order to reserve your spot in the school.
	However, this money is NON-REFUNDABLE! In other words, if you want to withdraw because you want to go to a different school, you CANNOT get it back!
	Therefore, think thoroughly before you put in your money!</p>
