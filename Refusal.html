	<h1>What would you do if you participants refuse to participate?</h1>
	<h2>For example, your participants do not want to join the yoga program.</h2>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p>Instead of forcing the participant to join yoga, I would ask the participant what he wants to do, 
	so I can arrange the activity for him.</p> 
	<h3>Commentary</h3>
	<p>Although the answer does above not reflect the realities in my rehabilitation center,
	I learn not to mention the ways my rehab therapists convince their patients' to participate in therapy 
	because these practices are not the best answer.
	In my first interview, my interviewer, Dr. Bright, asked me this same question.
	So I told her about my rehab OTs and PTs being a “good” or “bad” police to convince the patients to come to therapy. 
	The “good” police will kindly remind the patient saying that the therapy time is an opportunity for them to become stronger and more independent. 
	On the other hand, if the therapist becomes the “bad” police, the therapist will simply criticize and even threaten the patient the consequence for not going to therapy.
	After I told Dr. Bright my honest answer, she looked shocked. (in a bad way) </p>
	<p>However, I discovered that as long as you <b>say that you want to arrange the activity based on this participant’s interests,
	or use 
	<span style = "cursor:help" title = "It is a therapeutic technique in which the therapists encourage the clients, and their caregiver, family and significant others to get involve in planning therapy for the client.">"client-centered approach,"</span></b>
	an important OT term, 
	you will score a perfect mark.<br />
	Watch out for <b>similar questions:</b></p>

	<li>What would you do if your patients are uncooperative?</li>
