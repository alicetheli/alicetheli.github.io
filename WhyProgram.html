	<h1>Why do you apply to this particular program?</title>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p>Know your school better than your interviewers. This means to search for:</p>
	<ul class="blank">
	<li>The curriculum</li>
	<li>Sites for field work</li>
	<li><b>BONUS:</b> Your interviewers and their most recent papers</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p><b>Sidenote:</b>I used the BONUS strategy.</p>
	<p class="indented">I want to come to TJU because of the great TJU professors. 
	I have read an article called “The Standardized Patient (SP) Encounter” by Professor Zapletal and other great TJU professors. 
	Although they know that it is “labor-intensive” to arrange a SP session for each of their student to practice their mock evaluation skills, the professors arrange a SP session for each of their 69 students. 
	Furthermore, the professors also give an individualized critique to each of their students after the students do their mock interview. 
	Witnessing how dedicated the professors are to enrich their students learning experiences, I realized that if I want to be a great OT, I need to come to TJU.</p>
	
	<h4>Commentary</h4>
	<p class="indented">By asking the TJU admission staff who my interviewers are. I know that my interviewer is Professor Zapletal, who is both an OT professor and a researcher. 
	As a result, so I took advantage of her research papers to strengthen my interview to gain the “kiss-up” point.</p>
