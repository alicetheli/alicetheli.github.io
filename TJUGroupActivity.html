	<h1>Group Activity: Make an OT program for participants such as, paroles, children who have autism, and the
	elderlies to raise their health awareness and increase socialization</h1>
	<p><b>Side note:</b> The interviewers may give you your participants not in any of the mentioned categories.</p>  
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p>I have no specific advice for you because the interviewers want to see how creative and collaborative you are. 
	Therefore, let your creativity soar and have fun with your group members.</p>
	<h3>Answer</h3>

	healthy life by creating exercise events and dietary awareness programs, 
	such as teaching them to cook their meals and took them to a tour to Whole Foods.</p>
