	<h1>Choose one adjective that describes you and tell me about yourself</h1>
	<h3>Suggestion</h3>
	<p>Answer format</p>
	<ol class="blank">
	<li>Academic Achievement</li>
	<li>Most proud accomplishment</li>
	<li>Interests outside of school</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p class="indented">	I am proactive. I always made sure that I learn as much as I can from the classes by participating in class discussions 
	and making sure that my questions are answered by the end of that lecture. Therefore, many of my professors remembered me and 
	even said hi to me after they taught me in a course consisting of two hundred plus students. 
	For example, my social psychology professor says hi to me in the gym after I took her course which consists of two hundred plus students.</p>
	<p class="indented">Not only am I proactive in the academic setting, but I am also proactive in empowering people who have disability. 
	I not only volunteer in my rehab center, helping my therapist, I also help an ALS patient to control the computer without his hands, 
	but by using his head and neck. I utilized a software call the <a href="www.cameramouse.org" target="_blank">Camera Mouse</a>, 
	which used the webcam to detect the usersâ€™ head and neck, 
	such that the user can control the computer cursor by moving their head and neck. I also used <a href="http://polital.com/cntd/" target="_blank">CNTDesigner</a>,
	so I can customize an on-screen keyboard for the ALS patient to type faster. 
	By the end of our sessions, the patient had already sent three letters to his wife and two daughters, 
	telling them how much he loves them. 
	Plus, he can now type a sentence in less than three minutes.</p>
	<p class="indented">	I am also proactive about my health. Currently, I am swimming every day because I consider swimming as anti-aging aquatic therapy. 
	Some of the friends I met from swimming are over sixty years old. BUT! They still swim like a fish! As a result, 
	I believe that swimming is the key to active aging.</p>
	<h3>Suggestion 2</h3>
