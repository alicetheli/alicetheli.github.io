<h1>Building your resume and CVs</h1>
<p>Your CV is important because you are going to use it not only for OTCAS, but also for schools. 
Some schools, like USC and VCU, required you to hand in your CV, although you already made one in OTCAS.</p> 
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<h3>1. Read other people's resume</h3>
<p>Seriously. This is how I learn to write CVs. Here are my CVs  in different formats:<br />
<a href="CV.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a><br />
<a href="CV.doc" target="_blank">97-2003 Word</a>.<br />
I purposely give you a Word 97-2003 document because I want to show how I do my spacing in my CV. 
Also, you can make your own CV by changing the words from my word document. I hope this helps. </p>
<h3>2. Do NOT worrying about quantifying your achievement. Think how your accomplishments related to OT</h3>
<p>OT is NOT business. If you cannot quantify what you have done, you are fine. However, you should think <i><b>how your past achievements is related to therapy, 
or even better related to OT.</i></b>
For example, there is no way I can quantify my accomplishments as a volunteer in a rehab center, but I can say how my experiences help me get ready to become an OT:</p>
<h4>THERAPIST AID, Elmwood Skill Nursing and Rehabilitation, Berkeley          			September 2013-Present</h4>
<ul class="blank">
<li>Conducted a discussion about the therapeutic value of Myo, a gesture control armband</li>
<li>Engaged in self-directed learning to understand patientsâ€™ evaluations and the unique roles of each therapist.</li>
</ul>  
<h3>3. Better short, than long</h3>
<p>The point of your CV is to let your admission staff know you in about a minute.
Therefore, if you do not fill in the whole two pages of your CV, YOU ARE FINE. I did not fully fill my CV as well. 
It is better to be concise than to fill in the whole two pages of nothing and irritate the admission staff.</p>
<h3>4. Always ask somebody to read your resumes and CVs</h3>
<p>Maybe it is a no brainer for most of you. However, I want to emphasized it. I believe that there are times when you 
think your applications and resume are great, but maybe it is not.</p>
