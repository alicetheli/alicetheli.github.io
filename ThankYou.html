		<p>As many and many interview tip books mentioned that it is important to write thank-you letters after your interview because thank you letters give great impression to your interviewer. However, because I am going to multiple interviews, I am going to write multiple thank you letters too. I decided to systematize my thank-you letters by having a particular format. I hope you will find the format useful too:</p>
		<p><b>Step 1</b> Dear <u> Title and Last name of your interviewer:</u></p>
		<p><b>Step 2</b> Choose your interview format and write your starting paragraphs</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th scope="col">One-on-one Interview format</th>
			<th scope="col">Group interview format</th>
			</tr>
		
			<tr>
			<th scope="row">Starting paragraphs
			<td><p>Thank you to interview me and answer my burning questions about <u>XYZ University.</u> </p></td>
			<td><p>Hi, I am <u>Your Name.</u> You have interviewed me on <u>give an exact time of the interview, such as 10:35AM to 11:05AM.</u> 
			I want to thank you for inviting me for an interview and giving me an opportunity to gain a greater understanding on XYZ University.</p>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p><b>Step 3</b> I am impressed that ________. (Make this letter personal by writing one aspect of the campus 
			that you find amazing so that your interviewer can know that you actually appreciated the campus.)</p>
		<p><b>Step 4</b> Then you can end both kind of letters in this uniform way.</p>
		<p>The wonderful experience I had today has confirmed my interests in getting my <u>MSOT or OTD</u> in <u>XYZ University.</u> If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by using my email address, <u>Your Email.</u> I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
		<p>Thank you</p>
		<p><u>YOUR NAME</u></p>

		<p>If you have trouble finishing the letter because you do not know what part of the campus you like the most, think about these aspects:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Campus Resource, such as having a cadaver lab, great ADL and pediatric classrooms</li>
		<li>What you think about the staff and the students</li>
		<li>Something that you learn from that day</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Dear Dr. Bright:</p>
		<p>Thank you to interview me and answer my burning questions about Huntington University. 
		I am impressed that Huntington University offers not only occupational therapy courses, but also NBCOT preparatory courses. 
		I am also fascinated by Dr. Short’s orthotic craftsmanship, Dr. Ford’s profound understanding in OT, and your commitment to find the matching fieldwork site for Huntington University student.</p>
		<p>The wonderful experience I had today has confirmed my interests in getting my doctoral degree in Huntington University. 
		If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by using my email address, ME@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
		<p>Thank you,<p>

		<h4>Comment</h4>
		<p> I felt this is one of the best thank you letters I wrote because I complement the professors, which can help me to gain the "kiss-up" point. :P</p>

		<p>Dear Professor Bathje:<br />

       Hi, I am ME. You have interviewed me last Friday from 10:35AM to 11:10AM. 
	   I want to thank you for inviting me for an interview and giving me an opportunity to gain a greater understanding on Rush University. 
	   The experience I had on that day is unforgettable. 
	   I felt welcomed and even accepted by the Rush University students, especially Ariel and Kristen: They have kindly suggested and guided me to County BBQ to have my delicious smoked bacon, fried green tomato and pulled pork sandwich to reward myself after the interview.<br />
      The wonderful experience I had has confirmed my interests in getting my MSOT degree in Rush University. 
	  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by using my email address, ME@gmail.com. 
	  I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br />
      Thank you,<br />
	ME</p>
		
		<h4> Comment</h4>
		<p>This thank you letter is unusual because Professor Bathje recommends me to take a walk outside the school, so I can get to know the student lives of Rush University. 
		Therefore, I am basically reporting her that I like living around Rush University, which made me want to go to Rush University more.</p>
