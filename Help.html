	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p class="indented">The interviewers want to see whether you know your weakness and limits. 
	This is <b>an important skill for OTs</b>: If the OTs know their limits, they can both protect themselves and their patients from harm. 
	For example, I know that as a geriatric/rehabilitation OT, I need to work with multiple therapists because as a midget size therapist, 
	I know that I am going to be crashed by patients, who are twice my size.</p>
	<p class="indented"><b>If you have this question in your interview, do not get embarrassed!</b> 
	Be proud of this skill. 
	I do not know why, but when the other applicants are answering this question, 
	they looked scared and embarrassed. 
	The number one thing that you should NOT do in an interview is to look scared and embarrassed. 
	If you look like inconfident, then how are you going to sell yourself?</p>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p class="indented">I loved to ask for help because this is how I understand OT. 
	I simply shoot billions of questions at my OT during their lunch break, so I can gain a better understanding about OT. 
	Through asking them these questions, I get to know what evaluations my therapists use to assess their patients performance and how to read them. 
	Now I know Barthel Index of ADLs, Functional Independence Measure and Functional Scoring Legend. However, not only do I receive help from my therapists to understand OT, 
	I also help them too: I conducted a PNF review session for my therapist, and went through PNF theories, directions and techniques. 
	In short, we benefit each other to understand therapy.</p>
